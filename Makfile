Werror - Make all errors as warnings
Wall - Enables some warning flags
Wextra - Enable some more extra warning flags not enabled by Wall

fPIC - Position independant code. Code does not have to be at specific location to work
jumps will be relative rather than absolute.

Shared library must be compiled with -fPIC ( but not mandatory )
since shared library is used by multiple processes and it might not be possible to load it at a required location.

Shared vs Static
1) Linking done by os. Linking done by linker
2) Linking happens as last step of compilation process. At run time.
2) Compatibility is an issue. No issue since all code is in one executable
